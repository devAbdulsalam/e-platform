To solve these challenges, I would propose the following solutions:

1. Data Management:
    - Implement a robust database design (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL) with indexing, caching, and efficient querying techniques.
    - Utilize data pagination, lazy loading, and infinite scrolling to handle large data volumes.
2. Responsive and Fast User Experience:
    - Optimize frontend code using React and Next.js best practices (e.g., code splitting, server-side rendering).
    - Implement a robust caching strategy (e.g., Redis, Memcached) to reduce server load and improve response times.
3. Secure Payment Gateway Integration:
    - Research and select a reputable payment gateway Monnify with robust security features.
    - Implement tokenization, encryption, and secure authentication mechanisms to protect sensitive user data.
4. Real-time Features:
    - Utilize WebSockets or WebRTC for real-time communication between clients and servers.
    - Implement a pub/sub messaging system (e.g., Redis, RabbitMQ) to broadcast updates to connected clients.
